/**
 * Discovery — reading a tool's metadata back out.
 *
 * This is where the gap in `tool.ts` actually closes. A `HermesTool` carries its
 * schema and tags through the kernel's registry untouched; this reads them back
 * and renders them into the two vocabularies that need them:
 *
 * - `@hermes/model`'s `ToolDefinition` — what a model is told.
 * - `@hermes/agent`'s `AvailableCapability` — what a reasoner may ask for.
 *
 * ## Why this package does not import `@hermes/agent`
 *
 * It would be one line and it is rejected. `@hermes/agent` is a *consumer* of
 * capabilities; a tool package that imported it would make every tool depend on
 * the reasoning framework — the same argument that put the model contracts in
 * their own package (RFC-0005 §4).
 *
 * So {@link describe} returns a shape that is **structurally identical** to
 * `AvailableCapability` without naming it: `{ name, kind, description, parameters,
 * tags }`. A host assigns it straight across with no adapter. That claim spans
 * two packages, so it is pinned by a compile-time assertion in
 * `tests/capability-compatibility.test.ts` — which is why `@hermes/agent` is a
 * **devDependency** here and not a real one. The test needs to see it; the code
 * must not.
 *
 * Same trick, same reason, as `EmbeddingModel` and memory's `EmbeddingProvider`
 * (RFC-0005 §4.2).
