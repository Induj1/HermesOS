# HermesOS Status

A running account of what is built, what is verified, and what is blocked.
Updated after each subsystem. For the ordered plan, see ROADMAP.md.

## At a glance

- **25 subsystems complete** (incl. shared `provider-http`, `worker`, `rest`,
  `metrics`), each with an RFC, a README, and enforced ≥95% test coverage.
- **2212 tests** pass repo-wide (23 packages + 4 services). Lint, typecheck,
  build, and format are clean.
- **The model tier is complete** (#14–20): embedding platform, router, and the
  OpenAI/Ollama, Anthropic, and Gemini providers — all verified against
  high-fidelity fakes, with only live API calls left. **The runtime tier is
  underway**: scheduler (#21), worker (#22), and the REST layer (#24) are done;
  metrics (#33) lands the first observability piece.
- **Remaining:** CLI (#25), Telegram (#23, gated), auth/authz (#26–27), plugin
  SDK/loader (#28–29), and the aggregate Observability view (#32) — then the
  Production tier (#36–41, scoped in `docs/architecture/production-tier.md`).
  Configuration (#30), Secrets (#31), Tracing (#34), and Health (#35) are done;
  metrics/tracing/health now cover the observability primitives. None are
  blocked; each is buildable against fakes.
- **Tracked consolidation:** the cancellable-`sleep` helper is duplicated in
  `@hermes/embedding` and `@hermes/tools-github`; the worker now uses the
  kernel's `Clock` instead. Refactoring the other two would change their public
  `sleep` option, so it is deferred as a deliberate, low-risk cleanup rather
  than done at session end.

## Production tier — defined, not yet built

The Production tier (#36–41) is scoped in
[`docs/architecture/production-tier.md`](docs/architecture/production-tier.md):
milestone number, package (most are repo-level artifacts, not packages),
responsibilities, dependencies, and completion criteria for each. In short —
**#36 Docker** (multi-stage image + Compose stack, config from the environment),
**#37 CI/CD** (the local gate suite run on every PR; image build on a tag),
**#38 Security Audit** (document each existing trust boundary → control →
residual risk, plus `pnpm audit`), **#39 Load Testing** (`@hermes/loadtest`, a
deterministic in-process harness over the REST app and worker), **#40
Performance Optimization** (measured, behaviour-preserving changes found via
#39), and **#41 Production Documentation** (deployment guide, config reference,
ops runbook, credential list). They depend on the platform tier (#25–35) landing
first.

## Simulated / awaiting live verification

- **Git remote operations** (`@hermes/tools-git`) — `clone`, `fetch`, `pull`,
  and `push` are implemented and unit-tested against `FakeGitExecutor` (argv and
  result-shaping, including a rejected-push report). The full local lifecycle is
  verified against **real git** in `integration.test.ts`. What is _not_ covered:
  a live round-trip to an authenticated remote, which needs a credential (an SSH
  key, a token, or a credential helper) the build does not have. **To confirm
  live:** point `push`/`pull` at a real credentialed remote and assert the
  transfer. See RFC-0010 §10.

- **GitHub Integration** (`@hermes/tools-github`) — the REST and GraphQL
  clients, the auth abstraction (PAT, unauthenticated, and the GitHub App JWT →
  installation-token flow), pagination, retries, rate-limit handling, webhook
  signature verification, and the repository/issue/PR/workflow/release facade
  are **all implemented and verified against `FakeGitHubServer`** (98 tests,
  contract tests included). What needs a credential to confirm live: (1) a real
  REST/GraphQL round-trip against `api.github.com` with a **personal access
  token**; (2) the **GitHub App** flow end to end — a real App ID and RSA
  private key signing a JWT GitHub accepts, exchanged for an installation token;
  (3) a real signed **webhook** delivery from GitHub. **To confirm live:**
  supply a `FetchHttpClient` and a token (and, for the App and webhook, an App
  key and a configured webhook secret). None are code gaps — see RFC-0011 §9.

- **Browser Automation** (`@hermes/tools-browser`) — the Playwright-shaped port,
  the session, all the tools, and a high-fidelity `FakeBrowser` are
  **implemented and verified** (99 tests). The fake fetches page content through
  the shared HTTP layer, so navigation, redirects, SSRF policy, and network
  failures are genuinely exercised. What needs a **real browser runtime** to
  confirm: a `PlaywrightBrowser` backend implementing the same port over
  Chromium, plus the JavaScript-driven behaviour the fake approximates with its
  `data-fk-*` protocol (real CSS visibility, live DOM mutation, real
  dialogs/downloads). **To confirm live:** implement `PlaywrightBrowser` and run
  the tool suite against it. Not a code gap in the port or tools — see RFC-0012
  §8.

- **Embedding Service** (`@hermes/embedding`) — the whole platform (batching,
  bounded concurrency, retries with backoff, deterministic ordering,
  cancellation and timeout, normalization, usage/cost, capability negotiation)
  is **implemented and verified** against `FakeEmbeddingProvider` (108 tests).
  The `HttpEmbeddingProvider` base is verified against a fake HTTP client with
  an OpenAI-shaped subclass. What needs a **real embedding provider** to
  confirm: concrete providers (#16–18) implementing
  `buildRequest`/`parseResponse` against the real wire format, with live auth,
  rate-limit headers, and error bodies — and the full chain (provider → service
  → `toModelEmbedding` → `MemoryService`) storing real vectors. **To confirm
  live:** implement a provider and supply a key or a local server. Not a
  platform gap — see RFC-0013 §12.

- **OpenAI Provider** (`@hermes/provider-openai`) — chat/tool-calling and
  embeddings over the OpenAI wire format are **implemented and verified**
  against a fake HTTP client (45 tests): message/tool/response mapping, the full
  status/transport error classification, and embeddings end to end through the
  `EmbeddingService`. The same package targets Azure, Ollama's `/v1`, and vLLM
  by `baseUrl`. What needs a live **`OPENAI_API_KEY`** (or a compatible
  endpoint): confirming the request shape and error bodies match live OpenAI,
  and a real chat/embedding round-trip. Streaming is intentionally unimplemented
  until the transport supports it. Not a code gap — see RFC-0015 §8.

- **Anthropic Provider** (`@hermes/provider-anthropic`) — chat/tool-calling over
  the Messages API is **implemented and verified** against a fake HTTP client
  (35 tests): the system-hoist + content-block + role-coalescing message bridge,
  the full request shaping and `tool_choice` mapping, response parsing, and the
  status/transport error classification (incl. `529` overloaded → retryable).
  What needs a live **`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`**: confirming the wire shape and error
  bodies match live Anthropic and a real (multi-tool) round-trip. No embedding
  API; streaming unimplemented until the transport supports it. See RFC-0016 §5.

- **Gemini Provider** (`@hermes/provider-google`) — chat/tool-calling over the
  `generateContent` API is **implemented and verified** against a fake HTTP
  client (24 tests): the user/model-role + systemInstruction + parts bridge
  (incl. the tool-result name-vs-id fallback and role coalescing), request
  shaping and `functionCallingConfig` mapping, response parsing, and the
  shared-classifier wiring (incl. the context-length override). What needs a
  live **`GEMINI_API_KEY`**: confirming the wire shape and a real round-trip.
  Chat/tools only; streaming unimplemented. See RFC-0019 §4.

The remaining rows fill in as further credential-gated subsystems are built:
each lists what is implemented, what is exercised against a fake, the exact
credential required, and what remains to confirm live.

## Known limitations carried forward

These are documented in the relevant RFCs and are deliberate, not defects:

- **Steps cannot exchange data through the kernel** (RFC-0001 §11.4) — closed by
  the execution engine's `$from` references (RFC-0004).
- **A session inside a kernel task is invisible to the scheduler** (RFC-0005
  §7.4) — inherited from RFC-0001 §11.3; use a `PlanDecision` for scheduler
  visibility.
- **Filesystem symlinks are reported, not resolved** (RFC-0007 §7.1) — rooting
  is airtight for path strings, best-effort for links.
- **Tool versioning is declared, not enforced** (RFC-0006 §7.3) — waits for the
  Plugin Loader, its first consumer.
- **Path confinement is duplicated** between `@hermes/tools-fs` and
  `@hermes/tools-git` (RFC-0010 §7) — a deliberate choice over coupling git to
  the filesystem tools package; it graduates to a shared utility at the third
  consumer (rule of three).
- **The embedding platform does not tokenize** (RFC-0013 §13) — `maxInputTokens`
  is advisory; it does not pre-split an over-long text, and normalization is L2
  only. A provider surfaces an over-length input as `INVALID_REQUEST`.
- **The browser DOM engine is a subset** (RFC-0012 §9) — no HTML5 implicit
  closing, a limited CSS grammar, and text nodes fold into their parent; the
  fake runs no JavaScript (behaviours use a `data-fk-*` protocol). A real
  Playwright backend removes these limits.
- **Git failure classification is best-effort** (RFC-0010 §6) — it keys on git's
  human-facing message strings; the exit code and raw output are always carried
  so a caller need not trust the derived code.

## Verification

Every commit passes
`pnpm lint && pnpm typecheck && pnpm build && pnpm test && pnpm format`.
Coverage thresholds (95% lines/branches/functions/statements) are enforced per
package in `vitest.config.ts`, so a drop fails CI rather than being noticed
later.
